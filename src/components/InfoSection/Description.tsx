        First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can check out the quickstart guide to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge and minify the generated CSS.

      You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this comparison table to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.
